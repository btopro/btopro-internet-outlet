<p>So. This is really happening. Welcome back to Bryan's Internet Outlet.</p>
<h2 id="header-e569d92b-4498-8d91-9ade-ae3665080858">What.. is this</h2>
<p>Back in 1996, my dad handed me a book about this thing called HTML. I sat and learned how to write HTML on a 486DX laptop. It was thrilling. The ability to write a few lines of code and see the output almost immediately. Then... to be able to take that and upload (FTP at the time) to a webserver and then send a URL to someone and it load.</p>
<p>Damn. It was the future. A website you could own, maintain and publish to spaces by clicking upload. Why, it was so easy a 7th grader could figure it out.</p>
<h2 id="header-31313582-4400-e861-e001-2c8ef37c109c">But we have that..</h2>
<p>Do we? Is it simple to make a website that you actually own and can control? Or have you simply told yourself that. That learning massive toolchains that change constantly to publish content that is written in IDEs in markdown. That's awesome you can build an advanced website that way; but the web as moved so far down the road since then and yet, so many less people can participate in ownership of the web.</p>
<p>This site is an omage to the first website I ever made, but also a ranting ground. It's a space that I can use to write about the web and it's future that we build and give away daily.</p>
<h2 id="header-0bf8bbc6-ac76-7ea8-61e2-82adc7d1a1b9">But like.. what is this?</h2>
<p>This is a custom HAX site with a custom theme. It's developed locally on my computer writing HTML by typing. Here I will blog about where our community is going, how we'll get there, and what I see as the future of web authoring one Ubiquitous publishing experience at a time.</p>
