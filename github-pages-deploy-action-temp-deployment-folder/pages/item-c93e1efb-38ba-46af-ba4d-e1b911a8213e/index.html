<p>We don't need a world that is simply maintained and managed by the next maintainers and managers. We need bold movements into a brighter future. We need to live in reality and seek to improve it rather than just accept the status quo.</p>

<p>When we cling to the status quo we may hold fast to the good part, but we also may be accepting horrible realities in the name of comfort as opposed to action. The Joker's critique of a world that's horrible in stasis. While twisted beyond repair, there is insight into this notion of a terrible stasis in an example given in the film as he highlights the absurdity of "one little old mayor" vs "a bus load of soldiers" and people panicking when things don't go "according to plan".</p>

<p>If you couldn't tell, I love the Joker. I more so love this specific version of the joker (Ledger) because of the twitch, the dialog, the playing of people against their ideals. He is a very unique character both in comic lore and in this portrayal. The movie came out while I was in grad school and engaging in my research. Recapping 8 years in a sentence; it was written in the 1st and 3rd person because of the study of social engineering that I was engaging in.</p>
